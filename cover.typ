Dear Recruiter,

My name is Alberto, nice to meet you!

Since I was a kid, I have had a passion for computer systems, starting with my first video game, Mario 64 on the Nintendo DS. Growing up, I loved everything about deep internet culture and Unix environments.

As this is not made with AI, I can assure you that you are about to read some personal stuff.

I am from Italy. This place isn't as progressive as others, and I was never the type of person to go with the superficial. Living as a nerdy loser for about 10 years, I felt nothing but shame and hatred for the people around me, which is why I used to immerse myself in video games, shows, and computers. 

However, the world has a way of giving you chances, and you just need to keep an open mind.

One day, a girl named Elisa wrote to me. 

She is the most beautiful person I know and has taught me so much. I will never be grateful enough for everything she did for me. Because of her, I started wondering how I could support her in the future. What was a successful man in my head? Someone she would love even more? 

To me, it was being attractive and fit, expanding my knowledge of what I love to make it a profession, and knowing enough about economics to save money in the long run. And so I did. She pulled me up at my lowest, and I will never let her down.

Starting somewhere new and modern, with my caring and hard-working nature, I believe I can contribute significantly to your team.

On my resume you can find all the stuff, but I love system internals, Go and cloud/server related topics the most.

Here is something for you, many companies are gonna have a firewall with inbound rules to stop an employee to access malicious or nsfw websites on work time, will an OpenSSH reverse tunnel be enough to bypass that on your network?

That is such a simple trick as most companies are just not thinking about outbound rules.

= Hobbies
I watch shows, sometimes act as a bad cook, and go to the gym. (What's the cost of a gym membership in Japan?)

Today is the 20th of January, and I am in love with Sakamoto Days. I also just finished Dandadan and watching AppleTV+'s Silo. 

= Why HENNGE?
I like the name and appreciate the focus on security, Two-factor authentication (2FA) with one-time passwords (OTPs) is such a useful way to keep everything safe, and I love the way you made me generate a 10-digit key as part of the challenge. I think it is a smart approach to filter out people without wasting their time, and more companies should adopt it.

For one of my projects, I had to use an SMTP server to send emails. I tried using Postfix to host one myself, though I ended up using Amazon AWS's SES service. Related to this, I recently discovered your email DLP product, which is quite interesting to me.

Looking at your website and discovering about your company through social media I see a warn and welcoming environment with people wearing comfy sweatshirts which I love, I am afraid reality may not be that great, but you never know. 

Keep an open mind.
